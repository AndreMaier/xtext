This document specifies the language Xtend. Xtend is a modern statically-typed programming language which is
tightly integrated with and runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It has its roots in the Java programming
language but improves on a couple of concepts:   
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Advanced Type Inference - You rarely need to write down type signatures
	</li>
	<li>
		Full support for Java Generics - Including all conformance and conversion rules
	</li>
	<li>
		Closures - concise syntax for anonymous function literals
	</li>
	<li>
		Operator overloading - make your libraries even more expressive
	</li>
	<li>
		Powerful switch expressions - type based switching with implicit casts
	</li>
	<li>
		No statements - Everything is an expression
	</li>
	<li>
		First class support for template syntax, with intelligent white space handling
	</li>
	<li>
		Extension methods - Enhance closed types with new functionality optionally injected via JSR-330
	</li>
	<li>
		property access syntax - shorthands for getter and setter access
	</li>
	<li>
		multiple dispatch aka polymorphic method invocation
	</li>
	<li>
		translates to Java not bytecode - understand what&apos;s going on and use your code for platforms such as Android or GWT
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It is not aiming at replacing Java all together but meant to be used to write Guice-injected component implementations. Therefore its library is just a 
thin layer over the Java Development Kit (JDK) and interacts with Java exactly the same as it interacts with Xtend code. Also Java can call Xtend functions
in a completely transparent way. And of course, it provides a modern Eclipse-based IDE closely integrated with the Java Development Tools (JDT).

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
The best way to get started is to materialize the <em>Xtend Tutorial</em> example project in your workspace.
You&apos;ll find it in the new project wizard dialog.
</p>
<p>
The project contains a couple of sample Xtend files, which show the different language concepts in action.
You should also have a look into the <em>xtend-gen</em> folder which contains the generated Java-version of them.
